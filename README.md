A word processor without a delete button.


When you're writing something, you're tempted to go back and edit everything until it all sounds perfect. This results in spending half an hour on a paragraph, and that's if you're lucky. Draftil is different. After you press Space and the word turns from blue to black, it'll be there forever. The only thing you can do to delete it is to press backspace, which only strikes the word out.
